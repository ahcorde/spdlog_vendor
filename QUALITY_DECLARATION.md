This document is a declaration of software quality for the `spdlog_vendor` package, based on the guidelines in [REP-2004](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

# `spdlog_vendor` Quality Declaration

The package `spdlog_vendor` claims to be in the **Quality Level 4** category.

Below are the rationales, notes, and caveats for this claim, organized by each requirement listed in the [Package Quality Categories in REP-2004](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#package-quality-categories) of the ROS2 developer guide.

## Version Policy [1]

### Version Scheme [1.i]

`spdlog_vendor` uses `semver` according to the recommendation for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#versioning).

### Version Stability [1.ii]

`spdlog_vendor` is at or above a stable version, i.e. `>= 1.0.0`.

### Public API Declaration [1.iii]

This is a vendor package for `spdlog` and as such does not declare its own API.

### API Stability Policy [1.iv]/[1.vi]

`spdlog_vendor` does not have an API of its own, and will limit its dependency on `spdlog` to API stable releases within a released ROS distribution.

### ABI Stability Policy [1.v]/[1.vi]

`spdlog_vendor` does not have an ABI of its own, and will limit its dependency on `spdlog` to ABI stable releases within a released ROS distribution.

## Change Control Process [2]

`spdlog_vendor` follows the recommended guidelines for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#change-control-process).

### Contributor Origin [2.ii]

This package uses DCO as its confirmation of contributor origin policy. More information can be found in [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Peer Review Policy [2.iii]

All pull requests will be peer-reviewed, check the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#change-control-process) for additional information.

### Continuous Integration [2.iv]

All pull requests must pass CI on all [tier 1 platforms](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers).

Currently nightly results can be seen here:
* [linux-aarch64_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/)
* [linux_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/)
* [mac_osx_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_osx_release/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/)
* [windows_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_win_rel/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/)

### Documentation Policy [2.v]

All pull requests must resolve related documentation changes before merging.

## Documentation [3]

### Feature Documentation [3.i]

`spdlog_vendor` does not have features other than importing the external dependency `spdlog` and therefore does not require feature documentation.

### Public API Documentation [3.ii]

`spdlog_vendor` does not have an API and therefore does not require API documentation.

### License [3.iii]

The license for `spdlog_vendor` is Apache 2.0, and a summary is in each source file, the type is declared in the [`package.xml`](./package.xml) manifest file, and a full copy of the license is in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file. The vendored library, `spdlog` license is MIT as stated in its [Quality declaration](./SPDLOG_QUALITY_DECLARATION.md) document (Section 5.iii).

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has a license statement. [Here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/) can be found a list with the latest results of the various linters being run on the package.

### Copyright Statements [3.iv]

The copyright holders each provide a statement of copyright in each source code file in `spdlog_vendor`.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has at least one copyright statement. Latest linter result report can be seen [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/copyright/).

## Testing [4]

`spdlog_vendor` is a package providing solely CMake files and therefore does not require feature/API tests and has no coverage or performance requirements.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`spdlog_vendor` uses and passes all the ROS2 standard linters and static analysis tools as described in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#linters-and-static-analysis). Passing implies there are no linter/static errors when testing against CI of supported platforms.

Currently nightly test results can be seen here:
* [linux-aarch64_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/)
* [linux_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/)
* [mac_osx_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_osx_release/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/)
* [windows_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_win_rel/lastBuild/testReport/spdlog_vendor/)

## Dependencies [5]

### Direct and Optional Runtime ROS Dependencies [5.i]/[5.ii]

`spdlog_vendor` does not have direct/optional runtime ROS dependencies.

### Direct Runtime non-ROS Dependency [5.iii]

`spdlog_vendor` depends directly on the external dependency `spdlog`, which is qualified as quality level 4 in its [Quality Declaration](./SPDLOG_QUALITY_DECLARATION.md).

## Platform Support [6]

Comparing this table with the [Quality Level Comparison Chart of REP2004](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/blob/master/rep-2004.rst#quality-level-comparison-chart) lead us to decide that this package qualifies to Quality Level 4.

To reach Quality level 2, adding a Vulnerability Disclosure will be needed.

`spdlog_vendor` is limited by the quality level of the upstream dependency spdlog. In order to reach higher quality levels, the issues limiting `spdlog` will either need to be addressed by `spdlog` itself, or through adequate quality control measures in this package.
